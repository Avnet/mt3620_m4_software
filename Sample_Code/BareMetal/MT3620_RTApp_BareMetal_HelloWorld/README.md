# Sample: MT3620 M4 real-time application - Bare Metal Hello World

### Description

This sample app for an MT3620 real-time core repeatedly transmits a simple message over a UART. These messages can be read in terminal application on a PC using a USB-to-serial adapter. By default, it uses the real-time core's dedicated UART, but if your hardware doesn't expose this UART's TX pin, then the sample can be altered to use a different UART.

Please refer to the [MT3620 M4 API Rerference Manual](http://mtkcorfq01.mediatek.inc/AzureSphere/mt3620/) for the detailed API description.
